# Product Vision: TalentFlow

## 1. Elevator Pitch
TalentFlow is a web-based ATS + CRM hybrid platform that enables HR consulting firms to manage their entire candidate pipeline — from sourcing to placement — in a single, centralized system with automation and real-time tracking.

## 2. Problem Statement
- **The Problem:** HR consulting firms manage candidate data across scattered tools (Excel, email, personal notes), leading to institutional memory loss, duplicate outreach, no process visibility, heavy manual workload, and an inability to measure performance.
- **Current Solutions:** Excel/Google Sheets (free but unscalable), general ATS tools like Workable/Lever (expensive, corporate-focused), CRMs like HubSpot/Salesforce (powerful but not HR-specific), local Turkish ATS solutions (outdated technology, limited features).
- **Gap:** No affordable, modern solution designed specifically for the consulting firm business model — where one candidate can be tracked across multiple client companies and positions simultaneously, with flexible pipelines that allow stage rollbacks and parallel processes.

## 3. Target Audience

### Primary Persona
- **Name:** Danışman Deniz
- **Age / Demographics:** 28–40, based in Turkey (Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir)
- **Profession / Role:** HR Consultant / Recruiter at a consulting firm
- **Technical Level:** Intermediate — comfortable with web apps, Excel power user
- **Goals:** Find the right candidate for client positions quickly, manage multiple open roles simultaneously, maintain organized candidate records
- **Pain Points:** Wastes time searching through Excel files and emails, loses track of which candidate is at which stage, accidentally contacts candidates already approached by colleagues, can't produce reports for management without hours of manual work
- **Habits:** Lives in email and LinkedIn, juggles 10–30 open positions at a time, takes notes in personal notebooks or scattered files

### Secondary Persona
- **Name:** Yönetici Yasemin
- **Age / Demographics:** 35–50
- **Profession / Role:** Managing Director / Partner at HR consulting firm
- **Technical Level:** Intermediate
- **Goals:** Visibility into team performance, client satisfaction, business growth metrics
- **Pain Points:** No way to measure consultant productivity, no data-driven decisions, institutional knowledge walks out the door when consultants leave
- **Habits:** Wants dashboards and reports, reviews pipeline weekly, meets with clients regularly

## 4. Competitive Analysis
| Competitor | What They Do Well | What They Do Poorly | Our Differentiator |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Excel / Google Sheets | Free, flexible, familiar | No process tracking, no collaboration, no duplicate detection, doesn't scale | Structured pipeline + duplicate prevention + collaboration |
| Workable / Lever | Comprehensive ATS features, modern UI | Expensive, designed for corporate in-house HR, not consulting model | Consulting-focused: multi-client, multi-position per candidate |
| HubSpot / Salesforce | Powerful CRM pipeline, integrations | Not HR-specific, requires heavy customization, costly | Purpose-built for HR consulting workflows out of the box |
| Local Turkish ATS | Turkish language, local support | Outdated technology, limited features, poor UX | Modern tech stack, affordable, flexible pipeline |

## 5. Unique Value Proposition
TalentFlow is the only affordable, modern platform purpose-built for HR consulting firms — enabling multi-client candidate tracking, smart duplicate prevention, flexible pipelines with rollback support, and institutional memory that stays with the company, not the consultant.

## 6. Business Model
- **Revenue Model:** SaaS — monthly subscription per user
- **Pricing Strategy:** Tiered pricing targeting SME consulting firms (5–50 employees), positioned significantly below enterprise ATS tools (Workable, Lever) to capture the underserved mid-market
- **Monetization Constraints:** Must remain affordable for small Turkish consulting firms; pricing in TRY with potential USD option for international expansion

## 7. Success Metrics (KPIs)
| Metric | Target (6 months) | Target (1 year) |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Paying Customers | 3–5 pilot firms | 15–25 firms |
| Active Users | 30–50 consultants | 150–250 consultants |
| Candidate Records | 3,000+ | 20,000+ |
